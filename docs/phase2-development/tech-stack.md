## Hosting
**GitHub Pages (Web) + Firebase Hosting (APIs)**  
- **Why**: Both platforms offer robust free tiers that align with the goal of staying cost-effective during MVP development.
- **Advantages**:
  - **GitHub Pages**: Free, easy to use, integrates seamlessly with React web apps.
  - **Firebase Hosting**: Free tier covers basic hosting with HTTPS and CDN for APIs.
